This paper explores refining a Bayesian stochastic model for peptide identification, incorporating prior information about average relative abundances of bond cleavages and the prior probability of specific amino acid sequences. The approach is enhanced by adding additional ions to the model and using two goodness of fit measures. The complexities of the posterior density are addressed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and simulated annealing to estimate the true peptide with the highest posterior density.
